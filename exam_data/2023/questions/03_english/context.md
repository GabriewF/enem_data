# Things We Carry on the Sea

We carry tears in our eyes: good-bye father, good-bye mother\
We carry soil in small bags: may home never fade in our hearts\
We carry carnage of mining, droughts, floods, genocides\
We carry dust of our families and neighbors incinerated in mushroom clouds\
We carry our islands sinking under the sea\
We carry our hands, feet, bones, hearts and best minds for a new life\
We carry diplomas: medicine, engineer, nurse, education, math, poetry, even if they mean nothing to the other shore\
We carry railroads, plantations, laundromats, bodegas, taco trucks, farms, factories, nursing homes, hospitals, schools, temples... built on our ancestors’ backs\
We carry old homes along the spine, new dreams in our chests\
We carry yesterday, today and tomorrow\
We’re orphans of the wars forced upon us\
We’re refugees of the sea rising from industrial wastes\
And we carry our mother tongues\
[...]\
As we drift... in our rubber boats... from shore... to shore... to shore...
